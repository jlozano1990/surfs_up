# Surfs_up
## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to look at temperature data in the months of June and Decemeber in Oahu, to see if a surf and ice cream shop business would be sustainable year round.
## Analysis
### June Temperature Stats

### December Temperature Stats

- The difference in max temperatures between June and December isn't too extreme. Over the years, we can see June was generally warmer. The maximum temperature in June was 85 degrees Fahrenheit, while in December it only reached up to a maximum of 83 degrees Fahrenheit.
- The difference in minimum temperatures between June and December is a bit more significant. Over the years, June only went as low as 64 degrees Fahrenheit, while December dropped down to a minimum of 56 degrees Fahrenheit.
- On average, it looks like the weather was pretty similar in Oahu over the years in both June and December. The average temperature for June over the years was 74 degrees Fahrenheit, while in December the average temperature was 71 degrees Fahrenheit. This shows that the average temperature tends to stay consistent whether in June or December, which is a good indicator for our purpose.
## Results
Our analysis demonstrates that there are not significant differences in the temperature between the months of June and December, so traffic for our surf and ice cream shop business should stay fairly significant. I also took the liberty of analyzing the amount of precipitation within those months to see how much bad weather we could expect in those months. The analysis shows that precipitation is not something we really need to worry about, because it doesn't rain too often, and when it does, it's not usually heavy rain.

As far as more research that might need to be done, we could use our weather analysis to see what days have lower temperatures and use that to offer discounts on ice cream in order to make sure that we'll still have customers on days when the weather might not be perfect for ice cream.
